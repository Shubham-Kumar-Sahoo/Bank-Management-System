# Bank Management System

In this project I have used the concept of OOPs to create a Bank Management System with the help of C++.
This Bank Management System can perform the following tasks:-

i.  Create: Create a bank account which stores all the banking data of a person

ii.  Update: Update the banking data of a person

iii.  Search: Search all the banking data of a specific person

iv.  Transactions: Performs transaction from a person's bank account to another bank account

v.  Delete: Delete the banking data and bank account of a person
